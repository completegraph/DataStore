## Creating the Source Files

The source files in HTML,  XML, JSON formats are created manually for 3 books.

```{r}
urlhtml = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/completegraph/DataStore/master/book.html"
urljson = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/completegraph/DataStore/master/book.json"
urlxml  = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/completegraph/DataStore/master/book.xml"

```

# HTML Version


The original table uses rowspan to convey the 1-to-many relationship of a book to its co-authors.
This is illustrated below.

![HTML with table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/completegraph/DataStore/master/HTML_Book_Table.png)

However, in the parsed version, using the XML library, we see that translating the rowspanning arguments into a data frame creates additional rows for each co-author.  This is because the common columns are duplicated for each co-author.  Where the original HTML table shows 3 books, the XML and htmltab packages create a table of 6 rows.


```{r}
url1 = getURL(urlhtml)
hobj = htmlParse(url1)
booksTable = htmltab(hobj, which=1)
knitr::kable(booksTable)
```

## XML Version

We can use the xmlParse() command to load the document.
xmlSApply recursively traverses the XML document to extract the value.
Note that the authors have been compressed into a single text string.
Additional work will be required to unmangle the authors.

```{r}
url2 = getURL(urlxml)

xobj = xmlParse( url2)
root = xmlRoot(xobj)

dfxml = xmlSApply(root, function(x) xmlSApply(x, xmlValue))
df2  = data.frame(t(dfxml), row.names=NULL)
knitr::kable(df2)
```


## JSON Version

The JSON file format is the only one to preserve the structural format of the co-authorship.
The raw file is converted from JSON into a dataframe directly by the jsonlite library.

```{r}
jobj = fromJSON(urljson)

knitr::kable(jobj)
```

By inspecting the dataframe in more detail, we see that the individual coauthors are stored in a nested dataframe with data elements mapped correctly as in the first book.

```{r}
knitr::kable(jobj$books$Author[1])
```

## Conclusion

Of the 3 formats, the resulting dataframes produces are quite different.  JSON does the best in preserving the logical structure of the original input data.   XML is next best but the available libraries do a mediocre job to display the data.  HTML does not encode the logical structure of the information but rather enforces presentational layer details into the design of its table.
